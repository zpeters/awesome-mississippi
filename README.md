## Brief History

Mississippi joined the Union as the 20th state in 1817 and gets its name from the Mississippi River,
which forms its western border. Early inhabitants of the area that became Mississippi included the 
Choctaw, Natchez and Chickasaw. Spanish explorers arrived in the region in 1540 but it was the French 
who established the first permanent settlement in present-day Mississippi in 1699.

## Interesting Facts

1. Oliver Pollock, an Irish merchant in Spanish-controlled New Orleans who used his fortune to help finance

2. The Blues musical form originated in the Mississippi Delta after the Civil War. Rooted in the songs sung 
    by slaves working in the fields and African spirituals, the Blues offered an escape from oppression and a means 
    of expression for many African Americans.

3. While on a hunting expedition with Mississippi Governor Andrew Longino near Onward in November of 1902, 
    President Theodore Roosevelt refused to shoot a bear that had been captured and tied to a tree. Afterward, 
    a satirical cartoon of the event was published, inspiring a Brooklyn candy shop owner to create a stuffed 
    “Teddy’s Bear.”
