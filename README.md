Tell the world what is awesome about Mississippi
For many who grew up along its muddy banks, the Mississippi River is a thing to be admired, respected and, for some, feared.

It’s a winding body of water known across the globe for its volume and strength, with murky waters that are tranquil yet intensely forceful, touching 10 states. The river has not only carved a physical path along the Magnolia State, it has shaped the scope of Mississippi even before statehood 200 years ago.

Before the state of Mississippi was on a map, Native Americans heavily depended on the river for their livelihood and survival, with Indians from the Northwest designating it “missi,” meaning “large,” combined with “sippi,” meaning “flowing water.” As years went on, more and more settlers made their way to the Delta, draining swamps to create useful farmland.
reational playground, a cultural and literary focal point and a commercial highway for the region, the nation and the world.

Any body of water has always held a certain fascination for Adam Elliot.

“Even as a kid, if there was a mud puddle, I was going to get in it,” Elliot said.

Natchez native Adam Elliot spent his childhood along the bank of the mighty Mississippi River, and like many, he was told to appreciate the beauty of it, but beware of the danger.

“I always heard, don’t go down there into it. The whirlpools will suck you in, things like that,” Elliott said. “And I stayed away until my late 20s. Then I decided to engage, and I was hooked from there. I got into the sporting aspect and it just kind of grew.”

Around the time Elliot first ventured onto the river, he was restless in his job.

“So one day I left the keys on the desk and kayaked down to the Gulf of Mexico,” he said.

From there, he became an official river guide and manager of the Natchez outpost for the Quapaw Canoe Company.

“It’s not the place people think it is. It’s not what they see from the bridge,” Elliot said. “There’s miles and miles of this wild space that’s rather secluded. It’s incredibly beautiful, and it has so many things to offer us. Our towns wouldn’t be what they are without that river; there’s just so much tied up in it.”

## Brief History

Mississippi joined the Union as the 20th state in 1817 and gets its name from the Mississippi River,
which forms its western border. Early inhabitants of the area that became Mississippi included the 
Choctaw, Natchez and Chickasaw. Spanish explorers arrived in the region in 1540 but it was the French 
who established the first permanent settlement in present-day Mississippi in 1699.
