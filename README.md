## Brief History

Mississippi joined the Union as the 20th state in 1817 and gets its name from the Mississippi River,
which forms its western border. Early inhabitants of the area that became Mississippi included the 
Choctaw, Natchez and Chickasaw. Spanish explorers arrived in the region in 1540 but it was the French 
who established the first permanent settlement in present-day Mississippi in 1699.
